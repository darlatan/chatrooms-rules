#### Exceptions:<a name="exceptions"></a>

##### Exceptions for #Anonymity, #Security, and #Bnonymity rooms:
- Talks about Sci-Hub and/or LibGen are allowed
- Talks about torrenting anonymously are allowed unless the purpose is blatantly illegal ("piracy")

#### PSA Bans:<a name="psabans"></a>
Currently, the following rooms are sharing a common PSA banlist for serious offenders:
- #Anonymity
- #Security
- #Bnonymity
- #OS-Security
- #ModernCrypto

This means that those PSA bans are effectively applied on all those rooms and can be issued by admins of these rooms. See the next section for information about appeals.

Only admins of the the rooms above can issue those bans. Mods cannot issue those bans but can request an admin to issue one if needed.

#### Ban Appeals:<a name="appeals"></a>
- **If your ban is a local ban issued by a room moderator of a specific room: please contact the mods/admins of the room in question to state your case for appealing. PSA Admins cannot and will not assist you with local bans unless they also happen to be admins of the room in question.**
- If your ban is a PSA ban (usually formatted as: "date, reason, appeal status") and you are banned on several PSA rooms: you can appeal by sending an e-mail to <appeal@psa.aleeas.com> to state your case. This will notify the admins who can assess your appeal. Don't do this if it's a local ban. PSA bans are recognizable and are always enforced by bots.

#### Requirements for rooms to join the PSA community:<a name="conditions"></a>

- Main Rooms (not off-topic rooms) have to be related in some way to Privacy, Security, or Anonymity

Any "vendetta" or "action" from members between each others will not be tolerated. If a room leaves the PSA community, it shall be left alone in peace and offenders will be sanctioned. Any offenders from a "leaving room" will also be banned if they engage in harassment/trolling...
